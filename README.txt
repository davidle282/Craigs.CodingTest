Craigs Coding Challenge

Thank you for participating in our coding challenge, and I hope you have as much fun solving it as we did coming up with the problem. 
This challenge was designed to test your front end and backend skills, and how you can leverage off of existing 3rd party frameworks and providers. 
We have estimated it should take 3 hours to complete the spec, but if you feel like you need/want more time in order to go over and beyond the spec, you are more than welcome to do so.
So, let's get started!

Brief
Create a web solution to show a list of bicycles. You should be able to select a bike, and view all of its associated details.

Method
In the root of this repository there is a .sql file. This is a script to create a populated database, filled with information on bicycles for a bike shop (brands, categories, products, and stock). Your task is to create a solution that reads data from that database, and passes data via the web api to this React frontend.
NB: If you are not comfortable with accessing a database your api can also return static data.
How you build and design the UI is up to you, but you should try and include a table (for viewing/ sorting all of the bikes), and a second page/dialog that shows information about a bike when selected. Similar to other inventory management systems.

Things to consider
You can use this application as a base to work off, so feel free to remove/add things as you like.
This application has been packaged with Typescript, React (https://reactjs.org/), and Material UI for faster UI building (https://material-ui.com/), and would be nice if you followed the material UI standards.
How does the website look on a mobile device?
Can you use React Query for state management?
Are your UI elements resusable?
If something doesn't work the way you wanted it to - that is fine. Just add some comments (or an element) so we can get an idea of what you were trying to do.

The most important thing about this challenge is to show us how you like designing things.
Have fun
